The provided code is a C program named `mk-lunix-lookup.c`. Its primary purpose is to compute lookup tables for converting 16-bit raw sensor measurements into actual values for temperature, battery voltage, and light intensity. These lookup tables are intended to be used by the Lunix:TNG kernel module to avoid performing floating-point calculations in kernel space, which is generally discouraged due to complexity and performance considerations.

- **Purpose:** Generate lookup tables (`lookup_temperature`, `lookup_voltage`, and `lookup_light`) to map raw 16-bit sensor values to meaningful measurements.
- **Usage:** The generated tables are used in the Lunix:TNG system to convert raw sensor data efficiently without floating-point arithmetic in the kernel.

### `uint16_to_batt` Function

```c
long uint16_to_batt(uint16_t value)
```

- **Purpose:** Converts a raw 16-bit battery measurement into a battery voltage in millivolts.
- **When It's Called:** During the generation of the `lookup_voltage` table in the `main` function.
- **Functionality:**
    - **Parameter:** `value` is the raw ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) reading from the battery sensor.
    - **Calculation:**
        - Checks if `value` is not zero to prevent division by zero.
        - If `value` is not zero:
            - Computes `d = 1.223 * (1023.0 / value);`
            - `1.223` volts is the reference voltage for the ADC.
            - `1023.0` represents the maximum ADC value for a 10-bit ADC (2^10 - 1).
        - If `value` is zero:
            - Sets `d` to `0`, which is a representation of zero in floating-point.
    - **Conversion to Millivolts:**
        - Multiplies `d` by `1000` to convert volts to millivolts.
        - Casts the result to `long` and returns it.
- **Return Value:** Battery voltage in millivolts as a `long` integer.

### `uint16_to_light` Function

```c
long uint16_to_light(uint16_t value)
```

- **Purpose:** Converts a raw 16-bit light measurement into a light intensity value.
- **When It's Called:** During the generation of the `lookup_light` table in the `main` function.
- **Functionality:**
    - **Note:** The function is marked as "NOT YET IMPLEMENTED" and currently performs a linear conversion.
    - **Calculation:**
        - Multiplies the raw `value` by `5000000.0` and divides by `65535`.
        - `65535` is the maximum value for a 16-bit unsigned integer.
        - The scaling factor `5000000.0` is arbitrary and may be adjusted based on calibration.
    - **Return Value:** Light intensity as a `long` integer.

### `uint16_to_temp` Function

```c
long uint16_to_temp(uint16_t value)
```

- **Purpose:** Converts a raw 16-bit temperature measurement into a temperature value in milli-degrees Celsius.
- **When It's Called:** During the generation of the `lookup_temperature` table in the `main` function.
- **Functionality:**
    - **Parameters:**
        - `value`: Raw ADC reading from the temperature sensor.
    - **Constants:**
        - **`R1 = 10000.0`:** Fixed resistor value in ohms.
        - **`ADC_FS = 1023.0`:** Full-scale value for a 10-bit ADC.
        - **Steinhart-Hart Coefficients:**
            - `a = 0.001010024F;`
            - `b = 0.000242127F;`
            - `c = 0.000000146F;`
        - These coefficients are specific to the thermistor used and are part of the Steinhart-Hart equation.
    - **Calculations:**
        - **Calculate Thermistor Resistance (`Rth`):**
            - `Rth = (R1 * (ADC_FS - (double)value)) / (double)value;`
            - Uses the voltage divider formula to compute the thermistor resistance.
        - **Calculate Inverse Kelvin Temperature (`Kelvin_Inv`):**
            - `Kelvin_Inv = a + b * log(Rth) + c * pow(log(Rth), 3);`
            - Applies the Steinhart-Hart equation to estimate the temperature in Kelvin.
        - **Convert to Celsius (`res`):**
            - `res = (1.0 / Kelvin_Inv) - 272.15;`
            - Inverts `Kelvin_Inv` to get temperature in Kelvin and subtracts `272.15` to convert to Celsius.
        - **Scaling:**
            - Multiplies `res` by `1000` to convert to milli-degrees Celsius.
            - Casts the result to `long`.
        - **Value Correction:**
            - Ensures that the temperature does not fall below `272150` milli-degrees Celsius (approximate absolute zero).
    - **Return Value:** Temperature in milli-degrees Celsius as a `long` integer.

### `main` Function

```c
int main(void)
```

- **Purpose:** Generates the lookup tables for temperature, battery voltage, and light intensity by iterating over all possible 16-bit values.
- **When It's Called:** When the program is executed, typically during the build process.

        - Writes a multi-line comment to `stdout`, indicating that the file is machine-generated and should not be edited manually.
        - References `__FILE__` to indicate the source code file.
    - **Generating `lookup_temperature` Table:**
        - Declares the array: `long lookup_temperature[65536] = {`
        - Iterates over all 16-bit values from `0` to `65532` (`0xFFFC`), stepping by `4`.
        - For each group of four values (`i`, `i+1`, `i+2`, `i+3`):
            - Calls `uint16_to_temp` for each value.
            - Prints the four converted values to `stdout`.
            - Adds a comma and newline after each set, except for the last set.
        - Closes the array with `};`.
    - **Generating `lookup_voltage` Table:**
        - Similar process, using `uint16_to_batt` to convert battery measurements.
        - Declares `long lookup_voltage[65536] = {`
        - Iterates and prints the converted values.
        - Closes the array with `};`.
    - **Generating `lookup_light` Table:**
        - Similar process, using `uint16_to_light`.

        - Iterates and prints the converted values.
        - Closes the array with `};`.
    - **Program Output:**
        - The program writes the generated tables to `stdout`, which should be redirected to a header file (e.g., `lunix-tables.h`).
